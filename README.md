Translating the Psy software package to R Code and functions

**What Psy does**
Specify contrasts of interest for which you want to compute confidence intervals

 1.  Indvidual confidence intervals: CI for each contrast in the set.
 2.  Simultaneous confidence intervals (where the magic is)  
    a) *Bonferonni t* for between, within and between*within family  
    b)  Post hoc intervals:  
          Between main effects: Scheffe method  
          Within main effects: Hotelling's $T^2$  
          Between/within: Roy's GCR Method  
    c) Balanced 2 factor between subjects: Boik's SMR CIs  
 3. Scaling options (go into after replication 1 & 2)
